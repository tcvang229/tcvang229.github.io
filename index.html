								<h3>Hello and Welcome!</h3>
								<br>
								<p>Thank you for visiting my personal website. My name is Tswjfwmeng Vang, but you can call me ChuFu.
									I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay in 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science with an 
									emphasis in Software Engineering. I'm currently looking for a full-time software engineering position and
									am willing to relocate.

									About Me
								</h3>
								<p>
									A few hobbies that I like are cars/driving, Breaking, and hiking/exploring. All of my hobbies are always more
									enjoyable with my wife and daughter, so I try to bring them along whenever I can! I own a 5 speed 2005 Subaru 
									Forester XT, which is the turbo variant. Since I recently just graduated, I hope to do more to the car and take
									it off-roading and camping more often. My Breaking experience started sometime in high school. Dancing is something
									that I've always had a connection with, but Breaking taught me structure and what culture means to its people. I've
									learned a lot of my morals from Breaking and the people in it. 
								</p>

									Calculator Room was a weekend project that was inspired by a chat room service project that I had worked on for school.
									Calculator Room uses websockets and asynchronous functions for updating all clients when a new message is sent. The server
									sends and receives JSON objects and also stores each message in a JSON object that enacts as the "history" of the messages.
